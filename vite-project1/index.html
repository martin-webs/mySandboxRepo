            &nbsp;&nbsp;I have been given the marvelous gift of going back in time; the destination: Vienna, Austria the day: Friday,
            February 11, 1785. I arrived today and I am already on my way to attend the first of a series of six concerts in
            which Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart <strong>is conducting and playing</strong>; I was lucky to have the opportunity to
            be on this performance: <em>my uncle, Herr Haydn</em>, has a subscription for the whole concert series but he
            cannot attend it today, so I am going instead.
      
            I am at the Mehlgrube Casino now; there is a restaurant on the first floor and I am now told that the concert will
            take place upstairs. There it is. There’s exquisite food and varied drinks; I can even try my luck in the fancy
            casino next to the hall<sup>1</sup>, but I’d better go in the hall and look for my seat first. I daresay all the
            Viennese aristocracy has gathered tonight. There must be between 150 and 200 attendees; among them I can see
            Emperor
            Joseph II and Herr Leopold Mozart, who also arrived today, just in time to see his son play. Herr Wolfgang Mozart
            had come to Vienna in the Spring of 1791, leaving his father in Salzburg on unfriendly terms. This is Herr Leopold
            Mozart’s first visit in years; who knows if he will be back again, he is an elderly man already (over his
            sixties).
            It will be a special night for both of them. <br><br>
      
            I heard someone say that Mozart finished writing down this concerto while on his way to the theater! Can this be
            true? That would not surprise me. A composer must do the work of twenty men to put a concert on a
            hall!<sup>2</sup>
            Also, his new pianoforte and his very heavy pedal piano were also brought to the hall shortly before the concert!
            It
            is said that this pianoforte<sup>3</sup>, a Walton, is one of Mozart’s recent acquisitions, and that it will be
            brought along with his powerful pedal piano to this venue every Friday, till the end of the six weekly
            subscription
            concerts.

          I also heard the copyist was still at work when Leopold Mozart arrived at the concert hall and for that reason
          only
          the first two movements could be rehearsed, just once; this was corroborated by Mozart’s father, who after the
          concerto wrote to Nannerl that he had been to <blockquote>“an excellent new piano concerto by Wolfgang, on which
            the
            copyist was still at work when we got here, and your brother didn’t have time to play through the rondo….”
          </blockquote> <br>
          The copyist turned to be really outgoing and easy to talk to; after he was done with the parts for the musicians,
          he
          sat next to me and confirmed he was rushed to finish his work as fast as he could; he also commented that Mozart’s
          own solo score was not complete either: while the melody was fully written, the harmony accompaniment had just
          sketches and the figured bass; needless to say, the cadenza was in Wofgang's head. <br>
    
          The concert started at 7pm. Numerous candles were surrounding the audience as well as the musicians, providing not
          only sufficient lighting, but also creating an intimate and, at the same time, mysterious atmosphere. The program
          included two arias by a singer from the Italian opera and then the magnificent piano concerto.
          Mozart had the piano cover completely removed to fully amplify its sound. It was placed in the center, surrounded
          by
          the instrumentalists, in such a way that Herr Mozart had eye contact with the public, face to face. Among the
          instruments, I saw mostly two of each one: one flute, two oboes, two bassoons, two horns, two trumpets, one
          timpani
          and 12 strings.<br><br>
    
          The instrumentalists started to tune their instruments, and once they finished, Herr Mozart steps in and sits down
          at the pianoforte. The orchestra is absolutely focused on him ready to receive the cue to begin. We can hear an
          intense silence, which promptly vanishes with the unexpected, audacious and powerful 15-measure opening: a
          syncopated passage that suddenly announces that we will be experiencing intense emotions right from
          the very beginning: soft repeated chords by the strings in syncopes, and a triplet with three notes that rise to
          the
          tonic, all creating such passion and drama. There is no recognizable melody, however the character of the piece
          has
          been powerfully introduced through a group of creative motives. Now we hear a sequence, a transition that ends in
          a
          half-cadence and leads us to the second theme. There is a brief silence and what we hear is the start of a new
          theme, but no D minor, nor D major but in different major chord. The oboe and the flute dialog with contrasting
          rhythms, rising sequentially. Descending broken chords appear and a closing theme prepares the entrance of the
          soloist. <br><br>
          A new surprise: the soloist starts with a new melody, a dramatic tune that will last very little because the
          orchestra will join the pianoforte again taking it to the initial motives, orchestra and soloist are playing the
          first theme now. The transition to the second theme is intensified by the piano. And in the second theme, the
          dialog
          is not between the flute and the oboe, the piano is substituting the flute. After that, the piano through scales,
          arpeggios and three trills will create a climax that will take the orchestra hand in hand to the end of the
          exposition and begin the development. We can hear the first piano subject again but in different keys; the
          orchestra
          plays the agitated motives conflicting the lyrical melody of the piano. The recapitulation seemed pretty much the
          same as the exposition, except that we did not hear the first piano subject. Then there was a cadenza at the end
          of
          the recapitulation; a real treat to the ear.
          The beginning of the second movement was equally surprising; not only because of its soft, naïve, child-like and
          gentle mood, which dramatically contrasted the sombre agitation of the preceding movement, but also because it
          started with the soloist, and not with the orchestra as we usually expect a second movement to start.<sup>4</sup>
          If the first movement reached my most inners sombre feelings, this second part calmed me down, headed my emotions
          towards a total different direction, that of acute nostalgia, <em>“an evocation of the past and of a lost of innocence”</em>. The third movement was a rondo; the execution was not perfect but the orchestra did a fine job,
          considering this was the first time they were reading the score. There was something unusual about this rondo, some harmonies that I expected to hear were not delivered in the usual order. At times, it seemed as if its structure
          were that of a sonata. I really don’t know how to explain it, and yet, it was such an enjoyable music<sup>5</sup>.
          <br><br>
          There was a couple in front of me who after the concert commented: <em>“This music is shockingly passionate”</em>;
          two elderly ladies behind me murmured: <em>“Mozart is an extraordinary player, but his music is most complex and
            abstract”</em><sup> 6</sup> . That reminded me of what Emperor Joseph had said after attending Die Entführung
          aus
          dem Serail:<em> “Too many notes Herr Mozart.”</em> <br><br>
    
          In my view, this concert has been extraordinarily expressive, it displayed a wide range of contrasting moods,
          moving
          emotions, restless creativity. It sorts of narrates an intense story that cannot leave anyone indifferent.
          I kept listening to people in the restaurant: some say that this was really a tragic concerto; other comment that
          the Vienesse are not prepared for music like this; they did not come to concerts to be feel shocked. Maybe that is
          true, but who can tell what that shock ended up doing in their hearts. I believe in the end it had that spiritual
          healing and nurturing that only truly music gives the soul. Most expressed they want to hear the concert again; it
          is said that Herr Mozart will hire again the same orchestra and perform in a concert organized by the singer
          Elisabeth Distler next week . I have to be there.

    <li>Grayson in his Piano Concertos No.20 and 21 comments about Mehlgrube: “The Premiere of the Piano Concerto in D
      minor, K 466, took place in a hall: a large room on the second floor of the Mehlgrube, a city-owned building
      located on the Neuer Markt. A restaurant occupied the ground floor, and the large room on the floor above was used
      not only for concerts, but also for banquets and balls. In smaller adjoining rooms food and beverages were served,
      and gaming tables were available.”</li>

    <li>“Remember, it was Mozart's job to organize the concert, round up the performers, conduct, sell tickets, service
      soloists, have the pianoforte brought over there to the casino, everything.” (see Craig Wright, <a
        href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/introclassicalmusic" target="_blank">Introduction to Classical Music</a>,
      Video Course, Chapter 6, University of Yale.) </li>

    <li>Although there is no indisputable evidence that Mozart actually used the pedal piano for this concert in
      particular, some facts point towards that direction: the fact that he bought it that year (1785), the letters in
      which his father states that he saw this pedal piano being carried from Wolfgang’s house to the venues, at least
      twelve times; and a few bars of music written on the piano score in places where the piano is silent because the
      orcehestra is playing. (See Rirchard Maunder and David Rowland suggest in his article <a
        href="https://academic.oup.com/em/article-abstract/XXIII/2/287/371290?redirectedFrom=PDF"
        target="_blank">Mozart’s Pedal Piano</a> published in the journal Early Music, Vol. 23, No. 2 (May, 1995), pp.
      287-296 )</li>
    <li>Charles Rosen reminds us that in 1777, at the age of 21, Mozart was bold enough to place the soloist within the
      first six measures of the beginning of his Piano Concerto in Eb major, K.271 (see The Classical Style, p.202)</li>
     <li>Hsu Mei-Na explains it in her thesis on <a

        Concerto in D minor, K. 466: Analysis and Discussion of Interpretation and Performance</a>; she concludes the
      finale of this concerto is in sonata-rondo form. The structure is as follows: Section A1 (exposition), Section B1,
      Section C (Development), Section B2 (Recapitulation), Section A3, Coda.</li>
